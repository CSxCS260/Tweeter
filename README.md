## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User can click a "Compose" icon in the AppBar on the top right (not included since due to stretch story)
* [x] User can then enter a new tweet and post this to Twitter
* [x] User is taken back to home timeline with new tweet visible in timeline
* [x] Newly created tweet should be manually inserted into the timeline and not rely on a full refresh
* [x] While composing a tweet, user can see a character counter with characters remaining for tweet out of 280 




The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Improve the user interface and theme the app to feel "twitter branded"
* [ ] Links in tweets are clickable and will launch the web browser
* [ ] User can select "reply" from detail view to respond to a tweet
* [x] Move the "Compose action to a FloatingActionButton instead of on the AppBar
* [x] Compose activity is rplaced with a modal overlay
* [ ] User can open the twitter app offline and see last loaded tweets 
* [ ] When a user leaves the compose view without publishing and there is existing text, prompt to save or delete the draft. If saved, the draft should then be persisted to disk and can later be resumed from the compose view. 
* [ ] Enable your app to receive implicit intents from other apps. When a link is shared from a web browser, it should pre-fill the text and title of the web page when composing a tweet
